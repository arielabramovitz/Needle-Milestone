Caroline Glick wants law to let MKs keep foreign citizenship
Former MK Dov Lipman, who is from Maryland, said the law should not be changed, because it frees MKs of any potential conflict of interest.

Houston-born, Chicago-raised Knesset candidate Caroline Glick intends to change the law requiring MKs to give up their foreign citizenship, she said at The Jerusalem Post’s debate in Ra’anana on Thursday night.
A former columnist and editor at the Post, Glick said she saw no reason for the law, which would require her to renounce her American citizenship if elected to the Knesset on April 9. Glick is sixth on the list of the New Right party led by Naftali Bennett, whose parents are from San Francisco and who himself gave up his American citizenship when he first entered the Knesset in 2013.
Former MK Dov Lipman, who is from Silver Spring, Maryland, said the law should not be changed, because it frees MKs of any potential conflict of interest.
“As difficult as it was emotionally for me to renounce my American citizenship, it freed me to approach any issue that related to taxation, economics or anything related to America and Israel as an Israeli without any thought to how to benefit as an American citizen and therefore I 100% agree with the law,” Lipman said.
Toronto-born Likud MK Sharren Haskel, who renounced her Canadian citizenship when she entered the Knesset in 2015, praised Glick at the debate, saying she was disappointed that she did not run in Likud.
When candidates at the debate were asked what they would do to help immigrants from English-speaking countries, Haskel said that in the outgoing Knesset, she got the Transportation Ministry to stop immigrants from having to take driving tests, helped professionals from overseas be able to work in Israel, and required government offices to work with email instead of faxes.
