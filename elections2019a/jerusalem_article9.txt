Sara Netanyahu's brother supports Bennett, wishes he be defense minister

Professor Hagai Ben Artzi, brother of the prime minister's wife Sara Netanyahu, will support the New Right Party in the upcoming elections, according to a publication in Hevrat Hahadashot. Of course, the relationship between Netanyahu and Ben Artzi has not been the closest in the past decade.
Ben Artzi said that he "calls the public in all its might so that the minister Naftali Bennett will reach the position of Defense Minister and that the minister Ayelet Shaked will continue what she began in the Justice Ministry."
Last December with the escalations in the Yehuda and Shomron area, Ben Artzi attacked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In an interview with the Army Radio, he argued that Netanyahu "released the terrorists that lead the terror today with his own hands and acted against his own ideologies."
He announced that he is "praying that the moment will come in which Naftali Bennett is defense minister." Ayelet Shaked, the Minister of Justice, supported his statements in a tweet in which she called his comments correct.
