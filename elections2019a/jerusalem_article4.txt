Asimov inspired bot-joke pokes fun of Netanyahu's bots
Parodying the famous creation of Jewish-American writer Isaac Asimov, social media spoof demands that 'no bot will harm' Netanyahu.

Following news that the Likud Party allegedly used bots for political campaign purposes, an Israeli Facebook user chose to use the laws of Robotics composed by Jewish-American science-fiction writer Issac Asimov to poke fun at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.
"A Bot may not harm Bibi," he wrote, using the Hebrew nickname for Netanyahu, "nor will it allow for Bibi to be hurt."
The laws continue with "a bot must obey the instructions of friends of Yair [Netanyahu], be they the IDF Spokesperson or state witnesses."
The young Netanyahu is known for his provocative online statements.
"A Bot will ensure his own survival as long that does not violate the first or second law," he concludes.
The original Three Laws of Robotics were introduced in 1942. Asimov usually created stories in which these laws clashed with unexpected conditions.
